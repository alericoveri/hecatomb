#Hecatomb Quake II
A portable Quake II client  

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/alericoveri/hecatomb/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/alericoveri/hecatomb/latest)

This is the Hecatomb Quake II Client (a.k.a. *htq2*), another great Quake II client who's being intensely developed towards *high portability potential*. Serious decisions are being made. 
The main focus is portability, modernization and expansion capabilities, that means *htq2* is not only portable but also extensible. 
With the power and stability of Yamagi Quake II, 
Hecatomb has full support of 64-bit architectures.
processors and operating systems. This code is based upon the solid codebase of [Yamagi's Quake II](http://github.com/yquake2), which itself is based upon Icculus Quake II, which itself is built upon id
Software's original code drop indeed, oh well ... 

##Compiling
#####Here's what you'll need:
* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) 2.8+ and a toolchain (compiler, linker, etc.)
* [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/) is the only toolchain officially supported on Windows
* On *nix you'll need at least: 
  * [SDL 1.2](http://www.libsdl.org/)
  * An OpenGL implementation ([Mesa3D](http://www.mesa3d.org), nvidia-glx, AMD Catalyst, etc.)
  * [libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/) (if `HT_WITH_RETEXTURE` option is set to `true`)
  * [libvorbisfile](http://www.vorbis.com/) (if `HT_WITH_OGG` option is set to `true`)
  * (On *nix but not OSX) libX11 (if `HT_WITH_X11GAMMA` option is set to `true`)
  * An [OpenAL](http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal) implementation (if `HT_WITH_OPENAL` option is set to `true`)
* On Windows and OSX: dependencies are bundled into the source tree, so don't worry, it'll build out-of-the-box :)

#####Now it's time to compile it:
* Download latest snapshot of the source code  
  `$ git clone git://github.com/alericoveri/hecatomb.git /path/to/hecatomb`
* Create a build directory for holding up CMake-related files  
  `$ mkdir /path/to/htq2-build`
* Go to it and generate your CMake build files (it's your choice what you want to generate: a Makefile, a XCode project, etc.)  
  `$ cd /path/to/htq2-build && cmake /path/to/hecatomb`
* Let's say you wanted generate a sweet and plain Makefile, now you can actually build it:  
  `$ make`
* Le voil√†, you can already see the binaries on `/path/to/htq2-build/bin/<architecture>`a and test them:  
  `$ cd /path/to/htq2-build/bin/<architecture>`  
  `$ ./htq2 +set vid_fullscreen 0 +set deathmatch 1 +map q2dm1`
* It's highly probable that you'll be eager to edit your config files to your liking, they are located at your home directory:
  * On *nix and OSX, user files are located at `~/.htq2`
  * On Windows, user files are located at `%UserProfile%/Documents/Hecatomb Quake II`
* (On *nix) When you're happy with it, you can install your binaries:  
  `$ sudo make install`
* Enjoy!. Happy fragging!, there are great Q2 servers @ www.q2servers.com ;) ...

* Please take a time to read the [FAQ](https://github.com/alericoveri/hecatomb/wiki/FAQ), thank you :)
